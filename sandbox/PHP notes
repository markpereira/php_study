short open tags vs php tags?
	standard tags to make it portable.

Array
integer indexed collection of objects.

Associative Array
object indexed collection of objects.(index by label)
key - value pair.

Null and empty:
- 'Empty' is the leading cause of bugs in PHP code.

Type Juggling and casting

	- String
	- int, integer
	- float
	- array
	- bool, boolean

	php website has rules around how to use this.

	<?php $count2 = (string) $count; ?><br />
	=> change takes place as it's being assigned. not a permanent assignment.
	=> using settype will allow the change of type.


Constants

	- useful for saving data that's fixed. i.e root location of image files 

Switch statements
	
	- best used for compact logic. i.e. when you know there are a certain amount of things you need to list off, use switch statements.

For loops, While loops and foreach loops.

	- foreach loops are tailor made for arrays.
	- use foreach loops for arrays before using other two.

Continue

	used inside the loop to skip the rest of the current iteration and go directly to the condition evaluation that starts the next iteration
